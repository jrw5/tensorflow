Much of this work is transcribed from a video tutorial series. I will label all such files and make no claims to having made it.

Files:
	MNIST.ipynb - Basic tutorial of how to build a neural network with Tensor Flow. Direct transcription of work from sentdex youtube series, with modifications for latest version of tensorflow. 
	Takes in labeled MNIST handwritten numbers and trains a 4 layer NN with 500 weights in the hidden layers, and 10 in the final layer (digits 0-9). Iterates forward and backwards propagation 10 times and receives an acucracy of 95%.
